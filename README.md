## Summary
The analysis produced conclusive results showing that urban cities are the profit driver for Pyber and rural cities produce the least revenue. Urban cities have the most drivers and the most rides and produce the most fare revenue. Management should consider this information when evaluating expansion. It is likely not profitable to attempt to expand operations out into new rural areas and efforts should be concentrated on expanding in dense, urban areas.
